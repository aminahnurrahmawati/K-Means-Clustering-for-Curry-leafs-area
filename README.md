# K-Means-Clustering-for-Curry-leafs-area
This is the python code for K-Means clustering for 100 curry leafs area. I measure the length and width of each leafs and calculate the area of each leaf. To obtain some knowledges from the data I do K-means clustering and calculate the geometric means and geometric standard deviation
